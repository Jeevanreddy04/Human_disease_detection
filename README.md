# Human Disease Detection System

## Overview
The **Human Disease Detection System** is a machine learning-based application that detects diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system helps users check their health status online by analyzing symptoms using a trained model.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for symptom input.
- **Disease Prediction**: Detects potential diseases using the Random Forest algorithm.
- **Medical Recommendations**: Suggests hospital visits or medical advice based on predictions.
- **Historical Data Storage**: Keeps track of past user inputs (if implemented).
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to support more diseases and symptoms.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Tkinter (Python GUI)
- **Backend**: Python
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Algorithm
- **Dataset**: Hospitals' medical datasets
